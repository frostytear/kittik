KittikJS is a collection of modules, which are combined in this repository and available for you as SDK you can use.
It allows to you create ASCII presentations in a terminal with animations, embedding code, etc...

Take a look at few demos below and read [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for your next steps.

## Getting Started

If you want to start using Kittik right away without knowing the internals, go to [this guide](./doc/guides/how-to-create-a-presentation.md).
Even better to close this tab and open [kittik-cli](https://github.com/kittikjs/cli) package for more information (_after reading the guide, of course_).

If you want to contribute to this project, examine the [doc folder](./doc).
Feel free to open an issue, get in touch with me via [@ghaiklor](https://twitter.com/ghaiklor) and I'll try to help you out with that.
Also, there is a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/kittikjs/kittik) where you can ask a question.
