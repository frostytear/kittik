# Roadmap

- [ ] Implement Managers for lookup and access installed custom Shapes, Animation, Parsers, etc...
- [x] Stable enough and covered with tests [Cursor](https://github.com/kittikjs/cursor) API for freezing it up;
- [x] Each shape must be extended from EE because we need to know about changing properties in there;
- [x] Animation support (based on Shape + EE, we can animate properties and call re-render the slide);
- [x] Implement the following shapes: Text, Rectangle, Image;
- [x] **IMPORTANT:** Make a decision about initial font size in terminal (the smaller font-size the bigger resolution);
