# Roadmap

- [ ] Stable enough and covered with tests [Cursor](https://github.com/kittikjs/cursor) API for freezing it up;

- [ ] Each shape must be extended from EE because we need to know about changing properties in there;

- [ ] Animation support (based on Shape + EE, we can animate properties and call re-render the slide);

- [ ] Implement the following shapes: Text, Rectangle, Image;

- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Make a decision about initial font size in terminal (the smaller font-size the bigger resolution);
